=head1 NAME

MooseX::Workers::Engine - Provide the workhorse to MooseX::Workers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MooseX::Workers;

    has Engine => (
        isa      => 'MooseX::Workers::Engine',
        is       => 'ro',
        lazy     => 1,
        required => 1,
        default  => sub { MooseX::Workers::Engine->new( visitor => $_[0] ) },
        handles  => [
            qw(
              max_workers
              has_workers
              num_workers
              put_worker
              kill_worker
              )
        ],
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MooseX::Workers::Engine provides the main functionality 
to MooseX::Workers. It wraps a POE::Session and as many POE::Wheel::Run
objects as it needs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 

=item visitor

Hold a reference to our main object so we can use the callbacks on it.

=item max_workers

An Integer specifying the maximum number of workers we have.

=item workers

An ArrayRef of POE::Wheel::Run objects that are our workers.

=item session

Contains the POE::Session that controls the workers.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item yield

Helper method to post events to our internal manager session.

=item call

Helper method to call events to our internal manager session. 
This is synchronous and will block incoming data from the children 
if it takes too long to return.

=item set_worker($key)

Set the worker at $key

=item get_worker($key)

Retrieve the worker at $key

=item delete_worker($key)

Remove the worker atx $key

=item has_workers

Check to see if we have *any* workers currently. This is delegated to the MooseX::Workers::Engine object.

=item num_workers

Return the current number of workers. This is delegated to the MooseX::Workers::Engine object.

=item has_manager

Check to see if we have a manager session.

=item remove_manager

Remove the manager session.

=item meta

The Metaclass for MooseX::Workers::Engine see Moose's documentation.

=back

=head1 EVENTS

=over 

=item add_worker ($command)

Create a POE::Wheel::Run object to handle $command. If $command holds a scalar, it will be executed as exec($scalar). 
Shell metacharacters will be expanded in this form. If $command holds an array reference, 
it will executed as exec(@$array). This form of exec() doesn't expand shell metacharacters. 
If $command holds a code reference, it will be called in the forked child process, and then 
the child will exit. 

See POE::Wheel::Run for more details.

=back

=head1 INTERFACE 

MooseX::Worker::Engine fires the following callbacks to its visitor object:

=over

=item worker_manager_start

Called when the managing session is started.

=item worker_manager_stop

Called when the managing session stops.

=item max_workers_reached

Called when we reach the maximum number of workers.

=item worker_stdout

Called when a child prints to STDOUT.

=item worker_stderr

Called when a child prints to STDERR.

=item worker_error

Called when there is an error condition detected with the child.

=item worker_done

Called when a worker completes $command.

=item worker_started

Called when a worker starts $command.

=item sig_child($PID, $ret)

Called when the managing session receives a SIG CHLD event.

=item sig_*

Called when the underlying POE Kernel receives a signal; this is not limited to
OS signals (ie. what you'd usually handle in Perl's %SIG) so will also accept
arbitrary POE signals (sent via POE::Kernel->signal), but does exclude
SIGCHLD/SIGCHILD, which is instead handled by sig_child above.

These interface methods are automatically inserted when MooseX::Worker::Engine
detects that the visitor object contains any methods beginning with sig_.
Signals are case-sensitive, so if you wish to handle a TERM signal, you must
define a sig_TERM() method.  Note also that this action is performed upon
MooseX::Worker::Engine startup, so any run-time modification of the visitor
object is not likely to be detected.
